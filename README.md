# statistics for data scientist
Data science includes extracting data and results, and statistics focus on the analysis and communication of the data results. Statistical data science works to explain the trends and results of a data set by identifying the statistical correlations and distribution of variables and values.

## probability
The probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event to happen. It measures the certainty of the event. The formula for probability is given by; P(E) = Number of Favourable Outcomes/Number of total outcomes.

example of probability :

First we need to have a number of favourable outcomes or as known as n(A). Here we will calculate what percentage chance a male passenger has of surviving from all the ship's passengers

after that wee need  total number of events in the sample space or n(S).

then, We have to enter the values we got earlier into the probability formula = P(A) = n(A)/n(S)

## Measure of central tendency
The central tendency measure is defined as the number used to represent the center or middle of a set of data values. The three commonly used measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.

#3 Range
Range, which is the difference between the largest and smallest value in the data set, describes how well the central tendency represents the data.

example of range :
