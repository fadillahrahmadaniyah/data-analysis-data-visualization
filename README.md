# probability
The probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event to happen. It measures the certainty of the event. The formula for probability is given by; P(E) = Number of Favourable Outcomes/Number of total outcomes.

example of probability :

First we need to have a number of favourable outcomes or as known as n(A). Here we will calculate what percentage chance a male passenger has of surviving from all the ship's passengers
